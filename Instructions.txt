The objective of this game is to build up a new society with the vacuums of a once thriving Earth.
Aquiring resources at spherical (placeholder) nodes gives you the materials you need to rebuild.
Direct your people to these nodes in order to collect the resources you need.
Some structures will give you the chance to experience another person's story, their woes; make
sure to take the words of your people to heart by giving them the attention they need.

Future Planned Updates:
- Branching Dialogue that leads you down the story of your vacuum city, in demise or growth...
- Building improvements that allow you to create the submarine steampunk monoliths you expect to
see from the Mainline In Hot Waters game and initial storyworld pitch.
